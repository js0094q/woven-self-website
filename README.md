# The Woven Self â€” static site

A minimalist, accessible, single-page site for The Woven Self with booking via Alma.

## Tech

- Plain HTML + CSS (no build step)
- Mobile-first, accessible (focus states, readable contrast)
- Open Graph + favicon included

## Quick start

1. Install a tiny local server (optional):
   ```bash
   # macOS has Python 3; this spins up a local web server
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```
2. Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Custom domain support

If you plan to point a custom domain (for example `wovenself.com`) at this static site, follow your hosting provider's connection steps and DNS guidance. Once the records have propagated, test the domain in a few browsers to confirm everything resolves correctly. Need assistance? Drop a note in the contact form or reach out to the maintainer for support.
