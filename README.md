## ✨ Project Overview
This site is fully static — no build tools, no frameworks.  
Everything runs on:

- **index.html**
- **author.html** (modular standalone page)
- **blog.html** (blog index)
- **blog/post-name.html** (individual posts)
- **Tailwind CSS CDN** (no compilation required)
- **Vercel** for hosting and continuous deployment
- **GitHub** as the source of truth

This makes updates fast, secure, and easy to maintain.
