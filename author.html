        <div class="mt-8 text-lg space-y-5">
          <p>
            I’m Loren, the owner of Woven Self Therapeutic Services, LLC. I am a Licensed Professional Counselor in the state of New Jersey who has been practicing since 2014.
          </p>

          <p>
            I didn’t originally set out to become a therapist. I began my academic path in art education, drawn to creativity, expression, and emotions.
            My first semester of college I took an introductory psychology class and something clicked. Learning about the brain, behavior, and the “why” behind how we feel and act felt endlessly fascinating, and it changed my path.
          </p>

          <p>
            Anxiety has been part of my own life since childhood, so I understand firsthand how overwhelming it can be to move through the world while your nervous system feels constantly on high alert.
            That lived experience, combined with my training, shaped a deep desire to help others feel more grounded, understood, and less alone.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’ve worked with various populations and found my niche working with individuals and couples navigating anxiety, trauma, relationship challenges, life transitions, stress, family issues, boundary setting, and empowerment.
            I help clients explore how the lasting impact of difficult life experiences can alter mindset and the body’s sense of safety.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am trained in Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) and Internal Family Systems (IFS).
            I also draw from The Gottman Method and EFT for couples.
            I don’t believe one modality fits all, and I believe building trust in the relationship is the most impactful part of therapy.
          </p>

          <p>
            My approach is person-centered and collaborative. You set the pace, we move forward in a way that feels safe and manageable, never rushed or forced.
            My role is to offer guidance, insight, and support while creating a space where all parts of you are welcome.
          </p>
