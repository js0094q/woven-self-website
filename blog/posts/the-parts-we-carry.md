# The Parts We Carry

There are parts of us that learned to protect us long before we had words for what happened.

Sometimes those parts show up as anger, numbness, perfectionism, or the urge to leave before we can be left.
Often, they are trying to keep the nervous system safe, even when the threat is no longer present.

## What changes when we stop fighting them

When we approach these parts with curiosity instead of criticism, something shifts:
- We can hear what they are afraid would happen if they stopped working so hard
- We can learn what they have been carrying alone
- We can begin to build safety in the body, not just in logic

> You are not “too sensitive.” You are adapting.

If this resonates, therapy can be a place to slow down, listen, and untangle the story your nervous system has been holding.
