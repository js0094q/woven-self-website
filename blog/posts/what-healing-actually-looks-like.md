# What Healing Actually Looks Like

Healing is not linear.

Sometimes it looks like calm. Other times it looks like noticing when you are activated, and choosing one small step back toward safety.

## Signs of healing that people often overlook

- You recover faster after conflict
- You can name what you feel without being swallowed by it
- Your body starts to soften in moments that used to feel tense
- You pause before old patterns take over

## A practical note

In trauma work (including EMDR and IFS-informed approaches), progress often comes from building capacity, slowly and consistently.
Not forcing yourself through something you are not ready for.

If you are in New Jersey and looking for support, booking is available through Headway.
